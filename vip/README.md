# vip - vim package installer

## WHY?

Because I can. Also I was getting bored of cloning packages so I thought I'd
make something to do it for me instead.

## Why bash why not <insert programming language of choice here>?

It works. If this becomes a better idea I might port it to an actual language
but right now this does what I want and that's fine.

## You should use vundle

No

## No really

I don't want to use vundle. I like pathogen.

## But how do you install packages inside vim?

I don't. hth

## Actually, I think you're wrong and I don't think there's anything too complicated with "git submodule add http:/blahblahwhatever....."

ok. I like it when I don't have to type a lot

## But but but...

Hey you can install git packages however you want. I'm just going to do my way
ok?

## I'm an emacs user and I haven't got a question I just want to laugh at this and feel smug

Ok, do whatever you think will make you feel superior.

## Thing doesn't work
